# Machine-Learning-Using-Python
The Music Recommender System is a mini project using Python that predicts music preferences based on age and gender. It follows 7 steps: importing and cleaning data, splitting into training/test sets, creating and training a Decision Tree model, making predictions, and evaluating performance using accuracy metrics.
Project Description: Music Recommender System
Project Title: Music Recommender System using Machine Learning

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a simple music recommender system that suggests music based on a user's age and gender. The project follows a structured machine learning workflow using Python to load, process, and train a model on a dataset. The model predicts music preferences based on the input features of age and gender.

Project Workflow:
1. Import the Data:
Data for this project was sourced from the "Programming with Mosh" GitHub repository, which contains sample music data.
This data includes features such as age, gender, and the music genre that a user prefers.
Libraries used:
pandas for handling the dataset and performing data manipulation.
numpy for numeric computations.
sklearn for splitting data, training, and evaluating models.

3. Clean the Data:
The data was preprocessed to handle missing or incorrect values, ensuring it was in a suitable format for training the machine learning model.
Non-numerical data such as gender ("Male" and "Female") were encoded into numerical values for model compatibility.
Techniques used:
Dropping unnecessary columns or rows.
Encoding categorical variables.

3. Split the Data into Training and Test Sets:
The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the model.
The training set is used to train the model, and the test set is used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Method:
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to divide the dataset, typically in an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio.

5. Create the Model:
A machine learning model was built using DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree. This is a popular supervised learning algorithm that builds decision trees to predict the output.
Model selection:
DecisionTreeClassifier was chosen due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation for small datasets, making it a suitable model for this beginner-level project.

5. Train the Model:
The decision tree model was trained using the training data, which includes features (age and gender) and labels (preferred music genre).
Training Process:
The .fit() function was used to train the model by feeding the input data and corresponding labels.

7. Make Predictions:
After training the model, predictions were made on new input data or the test set.
The model takes in the userâ€™s age and gender and predicts the most likely genre of music the user will enjoy.
Function used:
The .predict() method of the model was utilized for predictions.

7. Evaluate and Improve:
The performance of the model was evaluated using the test set. Metrics such as accuracy were calculated to measure how well the model performed.
Any potential improvements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning or using a different algorithm) were considered based on the evaluation results.

Evaluation:

Accuracy score from sklearn.metrics was used to check the model's prediction accuracy.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (sklearn)
Development Environments: Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
Machine Learning Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
Conclusion:
This mini-project demonstrates how to implement a simple machine learning-based music recommendation system. The model provides recommendations based on the user's age and gender, and it follows the standard steps of data preparation, model training, and evaluation to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
